        Array can be multi-Dimensional
        ArrayList can not be multi-Dimensional

        Array is fixed size
        ArrayList ir re-sizeable,
           can remove and add new items anytime

        Array can store primitives and objects
           int[]num=new int[10];
           Integer[] num=new Integer[10]
           String[]str=new String[10]
        ArrayList can only store object
           ArrayList<Integer>num=new ArrayList<>();
           ArrayList<String>str=new ArrayList<>();

        Array is built into java as a data structure
        ArrayList is array based class that comes java.util package and,
                     it is part of java collections framework

        Array does not have many useful methods
        ArrayList comes with several manipulation methods

        Array can be printed using Arrays.toString method
        ArrayList can be printed directly using toString method

        ArrayList<Integer> l=new ArrayList<>();
        l.size()=>0
        When we declare Empty arraylist, it internally creates an array with default sie 10.

        ArrayList is Array based. Internally it is using Arrays to perform all the operations.

         UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
           1.SEQUENCE(code runs top to button)
                -->correct sequence of instructions are very important
           2. STORE DATA: we use variables to store data in programming
           3.MANIPULATING DATA:comparison, arithmetic, operations, formatting etc...
           4.CONDITIONAL BRANCHING: idf statement, switch statement, boolean operators, ternary etc...
           5.REPETITION: we use loops in programming to repeat same block of code. while, do while,for, for each
           ==========================================================================================
         NON-OOP/IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING
         -printing messages
         -primitive and String variables (until day 39)
         -math operations  (all programming language use these)
         etc...
         OOP
         we are going to OOP world(Object oriented programming0
         4 important concepts
         -Encapsulation
         -Inheritance
         -Abstraction
         -Polymorphism

         object Oriented programming-means that we use multiple objects and they relate to each other
         We treat everything as object
         so far, we have been using objects already, with String, Scanner, Wrapper and other classes
         We did not create any of our custom classes and
         In object Oriented Programming, we create custom classes and define data/ behavior in them.
         Sometimes, we establish relationship among our classes.
         OOP-Programming is divided into individual object that interact with one another
         When you say OBJECT, what is that?
         Where do Object come from?
         Objects are created from classes.
         CLASS VS OBJECT
         CLASS-is a template where we can define 2 important things
         -data/attribute
         -behavior/action
         OBJECT-is created from classes. We can create multiple objects from a single class.

         Class is a template, object is concrete.
         =========================================================================
         primitive vs non-primitive/class type
         primitive is just piece of data. that has no behavior
         class types/objects can have multiple data and behavior.
