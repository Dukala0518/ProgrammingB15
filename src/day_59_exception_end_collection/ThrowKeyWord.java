    Throw is a keyword in java, that is used to manually throw an exception.
    Throw key word is used to create runtime error manually/programmatically.

    throw new RunTimeException();--this line will create and throw  RunTimeException

   How to know if it is checked or unchecked?
   1. we can look at the exception hierarchy diagram, if exception
   is sub class of RunTimeException, it is unchecked.
   2. or we can try to throw it, if it compiles is unchecked, if does not
   compile it is checked exception
